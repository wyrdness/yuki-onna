## Overview

Yuki-Onna, the "Snow Woman," is a prominent yokai in Japanese folklore. She appears as a beautiful woman with extremely pale or white skin, long black hair, and wearing a white kimono, materializing during snowstorms.

Yuki-Onna encounters travelers in the snow, often leading them astray or directly attacking them with her freezing breath that drains life force. Her behavior varies by regional tradition - sometimes she is purely malevolent, freezing all she meets; other times she shows mercy to those who demonstrate kindness or bravery.

The most famous account is Lafcadio Hearn's story in which she spares a young man, warning him never to speak of their encounter, then returns years later as his wife. When he breaks his promise, she vanishes into the snow.

Yuki-Onna embodies winter's dual nature: beautiful yet deadly, capable of both mercy and cruelty.
