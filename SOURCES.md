## Notes on Sources

**Lafcadio Hearn's Influence**: The 1904 "Yuki-Onna" story in *Kwaidan* established the canonical Western understanding but represents one version among many regional variations.

**Regional Variations**: Sources reflect diverse regional traditions across Japan's snowy regions. Each area may have unique characteristics and stories.

**Modern Adaptations**: Clear distinction should be made between traditional folklore sources and modern popular culture adaptations.
